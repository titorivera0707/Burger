# Burger

### Motivation

* The motivation for this application is to be able to help restaurants manage their inventory as it is being sold. When an item is purchased the item will be taken out of the available burgers and put into the burgers that have already been bought. Restaurants/stores need to have the ability to manage their inverntory as it is being purchased to not have people buy inventory that doesn't exist.

### Features

* At this moment this application allows you to add burgers and mark them as devoured. There is a default amount of burgers on the inventory list and there is an option to press that the burger has been devoured. On the bottom of the application, you are able to write in a new burger to add to the inventory. When you click on the add buttonm it adds the burger to your current inventory list.

### Build Status

* This application is in very early alpha stage. This application is currently a framework for what an inventory and online purchase and sale website could be. This allows you to show inventory and take it away when it is clicked on and in the future can be modified for an application to manage large inventories for different kinds of stores.

### Future Development

* For future development, we will be adding the ability to make stores and restaurant POS systems to be able to access online inventory. We will make it so that only restaurant admins are able to change the availability of inventory items. Users will be able to remove inventory items only once they have been purchashed.
